# Development and Troubleshooting Lessons

## Git Operations
1. Bulk operations vs. Manual commands
   - Bulk operations might fail with new file structures
   - Manual Git commands provide more control and feedback
   - Always verify paths before operations

2. Repository Naming Conventions
   - GitHub prefers lowercase repository names
   - Using lowercase improves compatibility and consistency
   - Example: MCP-Github-Mapper-troubleshooting â†’ mcp-github-mapper-troubleshooting

## File Management
1. Directory Structure
   - Create directories before files
   - Verify paths before copying/moving files
   - Use direct file creation when possible

## Best Practices
1. Documentation
   - Document lessons learned during development
   - Keep track of successful and failed approaches
   - Share knowledge for future reference
   - Update documentation to reflect naming changes
